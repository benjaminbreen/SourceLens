# 📚 SourceLens

### Created in 2025 by Benjamin Breen, Associate Professor of History, UC Santa Cruz, with most of the code written by Claude Sonnet 3.7

SourceLens is an AI-powered platform for analyzing, annotating, and interpreting primary sources. Designed with historians, students, and researchers in mind, it offers tools for deep reading, metadata extraction, contextual analysis, and more.

I am a beginning coder and relied extensively on Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7 to write this code, while also learning about the tech stack and architecture from OpenAI's o1 model. Thank you to those who made these tools possible.

## 📰 Background & Philosophy

SourceLens was created to explore how generative AI might augment — rather than replace — the work of historians. For reflections on the project and its origins, see:

 ## 🚧 Status

SourceLens is in **active development**. This UI is a work-in-progress snapshot and will change substantially as I develop it to be a standalone, functional tool rather than a pet project.
